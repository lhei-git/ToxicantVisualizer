# ToxicantVisualizer
Fall 2020 Capstone Project

## Development
1. Select an issue to write code for. If no issue exists for the addition you would like to make, create one. 
2. Create a feature branch off of `master` with the format `feature/*` (ex. `feature/maps`). Keep branch names short: the suffix should be a one or two-word descriptor for the feature you are writing.
3. Make incremental commits to this branch. Smaller, more frequent commits are recommended. 
4. Create a Pull Request into `master` once your work is completed. PR candidate code must run without errors.
 
    3.1. Add at least one reviewer to your PR. Anyone can review, but a PR requires at least one approval before it can be merged. 

5. Once a PR is approved, either the approving reviewer or the creator of the PR can merge it into `master`.
