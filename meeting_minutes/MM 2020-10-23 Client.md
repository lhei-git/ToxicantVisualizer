## Current Conncerns
We ran into some trouble with th database and will be migrating to Postgres. Django didn't have good support for MySQL.
Should we use a range of years? Nic and the team agreed that a single year will be sufficient to show data due to the large amount of data

## Improving Google Map performance
Evan: When you geocode something, you  can calculate how big the resulting dataset is - we can then ask the user to refine the search
Nic: Possiibly still search if the user enters the United states, and either don't generate map markers, or just let it be slow (Performance isn't a hug deal to Nic)
Evan: Possibly use heat maps instead of individual facilities when there is a large amount of date

## Other Comments
Nic: Consider normalizing the data and splitting it into other tables
Adwait: Postgres supports more manipulation of data on the backend, so less will need to be done on the browser.
