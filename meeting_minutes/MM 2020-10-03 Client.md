## Updates from Nic
Nic made an Excel file for db structure he'd like to see (to compare with the the schema made by the backend team)
He wants to minimize calculations as well as have a more conservative amount of data in the database
He will send us an updated Excel file over the weekend

## Database Requests
Resolve parent name and replace parent name/ std. parent name in the data
Omit metal, retain metal category
Omit stack/fugitinve air by rolling it into the total air releases
Sum attributes 47 - 57 as total land releases, omit these columnt - Calvin alreade sums these
Split into 3 tables: Facilitieis -> Releases -> Chemicals

DOC_CTRL_NUM is unique for releases across years, facilities, etc
TRIFID is unique across years for facilities
CAS/COMPOUND_ID is unique for each chemical

## Current Work
Backend: Working on new db structure, then models and entpoints
Frontend: Any changes waiting to be made on the frontend are dependent of the backend changes

## Search Issues
Google Maps Autocomplete API and page between homepage and map can be used to solve ambiguous geography
Nic wants us to consider if there is a simplet way - force user to use city/state?
Grab cities from dropdown? Default to state for search terms that don't contain a comma?

## Other Issues and Ideas
Evan: Take thematic maps away from main search - when user searches for state, it will give a county map of the state
Bug: It's not alwyas obvious when the graphs are still waiting for data
Areas that have few facilities are barely visible on the Google map - Nic made some icons, wantes color to change when release type changes

## To Do
Add filter by Release Type to graphs
Add legend to thematic maps - consider taking off some of the darkest reds (they apprear to be more brown)
