## Concerns About Cost
Nic will watch the price of AWS  to make sure the price stabilizes after removing unneeded tables.
Site still uses Google Geocoding API - Nic will transfer that cost from Evan's credit card to his own.

## Completed Items
Overflow problem fixed - markers and data now only include data points from search area

## Current Issues
Themnatic map bucket issues are misleading - Rich will change the labels to make it more clear

## Action Items
1. Remove "All" from release type filter (dulplicate entry of "All Release Types"
2. Add filter bar on National Insights page
3. Remove "Over Time" from timeline graphs on Location Insights page (to reduce the length of the graphs' titles)
4. Add separate about page

## Suggestions from Nic
1. Change the text on the front page to something shorter (Nic wrote a new blurb for this)
2. Ghange the default text in the search bar to something simpler
3. Leave copyright text in page footer, move other details onto the new about page
4. Possiubly move photo credit from the photo to either the photo's metadata or the About page
